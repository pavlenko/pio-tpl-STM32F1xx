#### Advanced TIM1 and TIM8 timer features include:

- 16-bit up, down, up/down auto-reload counter.
- 16-bit programmable prescaler allowing dividing (also “on the fly”) the counter clock frequency either by any factor between 1 and 65536.
- Up to 4 independent channels for:
  – Input capture
  – Output compare
  – PWM generation (Edge and Center-aligned Mode)
  – One-pulse mode output
- Complementary outputs with programmable dead-time
- Synchronization circuit to control the timer with external signals and to interconnect several timers together.
- Repetition counter to update the timer registers only after a given number of cycles of the counter.
- Break input to put the timer’s output signals in reset state or in a known state.
- Interrupt/DMA generation on the following events:
  – Update: counter overflow/underflow, counter initialization (by software or internal/external trigger)
  – Trigger event (counter start, stop, initialization or count by internal/external trigger)
  – Input capture
  – Output compare
  – Break input
- Supports incremental (quadrature) encoder and hall-sensor circuitry for positioning purposes
- Trigger input for external clock or cycle-by-cycle current management
